Introducing Home Distance Tracker, a convenient mobile app that helps you monitor the distance between your home and your current location.

## Getting Started

Here's how it works: simply input your home address into the app, and it will use GPS technology to determine your current location. The app continuously calculates the distance between your current location and your home, providing you with real-time updates.

But that's not all! Home Distance Tracker also offers a notification feature. You can set a specific distance threshold, and whenever you come within that distance of your home, the app will send you a notification. This way, you'll receive timely reminders when you're getting close to your desired location.
