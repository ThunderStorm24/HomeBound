# What is HomeBound?

Introducing Home Distance Tracker, a convenient mobile app that helps you monitor the distance between your home and your current location.

## How it Works?

Here's how it works:

<ol>
<li>Input your home address into the app.</li>
<li>The app utilizes advanced GPS technology to determine your current location.</li>
<li>Home Distance Tracker continuously calculates the real-time distance between your current location and your home, providing you with accurate updates.</li>
</ol>

But that's not all! Home Distance Tracker also offers a notification feature. You can set a specific distance threshold, and whenever you come within that distance of your home, the app will send you a notification. This way, you'll receive timely reminders when you're getting close to your desired location.
